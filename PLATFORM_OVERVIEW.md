## The Problem We're Solving

### Pain Points in Conservation Science

**1. Fragmented Research Landscape**
- Conservation research is scattered across multiple databases (PubMed, CrossRef, OpenAlex, etc.)
- No single source of truth for finding relevant conservation papers
- Difficult to discover research across species, ecosystems, methods, and geographic regions
- Researchers spend countless hours manually searching through disconnected systems

**2. Metadata Quality Crisis**
- Research papers often lack structured conservation-specific metadata
- Critical details (species studied, ecosystems, threats, conservation actions) are buried in full text
- Impossible to filter or analyze papers by conservation-relevant dimensions
- Metadata extraction requires domain expertise and is time-consuming

**3. Knowledge Discovery Gap**
- Hard to identify research gaps and emerging trends
- No way to synthesize findings across multiple studies
- Collaboration opportunities are hidden
- Limited visibility into what's being studied where and by whom

**4. Funding Accessibility**
- Grant opportunities are difficult to discover
- No centralized database of conservation funding
- Researchers struggle to find relevant funding sources
- Grant writing is time-consuming and requires specialized skills

**5. Career & Networking Challenges**
- Conservation job opportunities are fragmented
- Difficult to find collaborators with specific expertise
- Limited professional networking infrastructure
- Hard to showcase research impact and build reputation
